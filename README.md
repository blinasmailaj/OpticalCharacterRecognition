# Optical Character Recognition
This project is built to recognize handwritten characters using artificial intelligence technologies, specifically the field of deep learning named convolutional neural networks. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) facilitates and saves a lot of time from manual work that is usually done in legal offices, banks, in medical fields, billing and so on. 

This system includes a simple web application that takes images as an input and outputs the prediction that the convolutional neural network generated:
